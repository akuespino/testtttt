<div id="span"> Significance </span> 

<div id="b3"> Solving this problem is vastly necessary for the welfare and lives of the patients that the institution has taken under its wing and for our community. This proposed project will help improve the livelihood of the patients affected and help prevent the further continuation of the viruses. Having the right knowledge will help them be aware of this problem and avoid being in cases like these. This problem has existed ever since the institution started growing and improving. This can help the audience  enhance their kindness, love and knowledge about the problems of our society. This will boost their confidence to help those in need and with the resources we have due to technological advancements, the project proposal will be a success in its efficient and effective manner of spreading the message we intend to deliver. </div>

<div id="span"> Problem Identification </span> 

<div id="b3"> HIV/AIDS has been one of the most, if not the most, pressing concerns and problems in our partner institution. In this context, the youth’s lives have been greatly affected by this presented illness. This problem has been identified as a sexually-transmitted disease and its rise in cases has been of great concern. Our best answer to the problem is help in the prevention of the said illness in hopes of HIV/AIDS cases to lessen. </div>

<hr width="300">


<div id="span"> Proposed Intervention of the Project Proposal </span> 

<div id="b3"> In order to solve the problem of the increasing HIV/Aids cases in the youth is to provide better understanding about the issues to others. The proposed solution will be effective as it can help the people in the community to be well aware of the risks and prevention so as to not worsen the situation. It is better than other alternatives because it will directly inform others on how to deal with such problems and what we can do to avoid experiencing the complications. It would take courage and perseverance in order for the project to work as it will take some time and patience for the project to fully work and be effective. </div>
