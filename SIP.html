<div id="b3"> This SIP aims to develop readers' knowledge about the benefits, impact, and effects of composting on the environmental issues our society is facing from the past and the present. Based on research from "U.S. EPA", the value of composting food waste is that it not only solves one problem but solves many. It solves different issues like water pollution and erosion. Not only can composting fix problems but it prevents them. It also gives beneficial 
impacts on these problems. One of the commonly beneficial impacts is it enriches the soil. Composting Food waste produces more elements that could help develop soil. Important elements such as potassium, calcium, iron, nitrogen, and more. This SIP research would give an advantage to the institution MAAAI, or known as the Mindanao Advocates Against AIDS, Inc. Let’s recall one of the stated benefits of Composting Food Waste which is enriching the soil. Enriching soil is important for farming because it helps in controlling toxic substances and weeds. This would mean that enriching soil would improve crops, crops like vegetables. Vegetables are important in improving your body especially when sick. The MAAAI institution helps society aim for better health. The institution helps people with diseases like Aids, Hiv, Tuberculosis, and more. This leads us to the summary that composting food waste is a good practice for its beneficial impact on the environment and one’s health. </p>

<div id="b2"> <p align= "center"> <font size="90" color="#FFFFFF"> -STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM- </p>
<hr class="rounded">
<br> 
<div id="b3"> We are faced with food shortages in present times, as well as resources to develop these needs. Our goal is to provide alternative planting methods to effectively and efficiently grow nutritious and green-based foods for the people in the community, in this case, the MAAAI patients. This experiment will test out the practical strategy for further developments in providing a better result and its effect on the patients to benefit from.

<div id="b2"> <p align= "center"> <font size="90" color="FFFFFF"> -HYPOTHESIS- </p>
<hr class="rounded">

<div id="b3"> If we apply compost-based fertilizer in the growth process of a squash plant, then the plant will grow faster than without the said fertilizer.
